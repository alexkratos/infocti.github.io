# Contributing to Home Assistant

Everybody is invited and welcome to contribute to Seria CD Website. The process is straight-forward.

 - Fork the Seria CD Page [git repository](https://github.com/seriacd/seriacd.github.io).
 - Write the code for a specific issue
 - Ensure everything works as expected 
 - Create a Pull Request  with a clear list of what you've done (read more about [pull requests](http://help.github.com/pull-requests/)).
 
 Always write a clear log message for your commits. One-line messages are fine for small changes, but bigger changes should look like this:

    $ git commit -m "A brief summary of the commit
    > 
    > A paragraph describing what changed and its impact."

Good luck!
